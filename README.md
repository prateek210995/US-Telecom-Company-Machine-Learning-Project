# US-Telecom-Company-Machine-Learning-Project

The U.S. based telecommunication company is trying to see if it can identify factors that cause customers to cancel their internet and cellular services. Also, if the company can predict whether a customer will cancel their service in the future. During the past couple of years, the company has experienced record levels of customers canceling their service. This led to huge financial losses to the telecom company. It is crucial for the company to determine the factors responsible for customer attrition and predict if customers will cancel their service in the future, as it minimizes future financial losses, build satisfactory customer relationships, and offer better delivery methods to customers.
The main aim of the analysis is to perform an exploratory data analysis on the given telecom company dataset and discover the variables that drive the differences between customers who do and do not cancel their service. Then build a machine learning classification algorithm to forecast if customers will cancel company service. The company can utilize analysis results in optimizing their product, reduce customer attrition and company financial losses.
